# elm-uploader-experiments
WT-style uploader in Elm. Not quite as stylish as the original but it does support multifile and drag&drop.

This is one of my experimentation repos for learning Elm. It is emphatically NOT production level code so you are entirely on your own if you copy this and use it for a billion-dollar project.

## Installation

1. Acquire a copy of the Elm 0.19 compiler.
2. `elm make src/Main.elm`
3. Open the newly generated index.html in your browser and enjoy.

## Usage

You can click on any of the buttons to see what happens. It is also possible to drag and drop files from your operating system file explorer variant to the page to add files that way.

This POC does not do any outbound HTTP requests.
